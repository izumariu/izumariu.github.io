			"Hey...<i>$R$...</i>"<br>
<br>
Izuru stares up at you from his position on your couch, lower lip jutted out in a pout. You're just mindlessly scrolling through your phone, so you look up at him as he speaks. "Mm? Yeah, what is it?"<br>
<br>
"I'm, ah--" Izuru pauses as a rumble sounds from his stomach and he looks down at it. It's already fairly sizable and squishy from the diet that he's held over the past several months, and it takes an almost embarrassing amount of self restraint to keep yourself from leaning in and hugging it yourself. "You know...hungry."<br>
<br>
"You are, huh?" you say with a small laugh. You only regret it a little when Izuru's expression turns a little cooler, and you pocket your phone as you stand up. "Let me see what we've got in the fridge then, hm? Fill you up and all that."<br>
<br>
Izuru pushes a strand of long black hair behind an ear and smiles. "Thanks," he says, and you move onto the kitchen, swinging the refrigerator door open. There are several sandwiches in there, as you expected, and you gather as many as you can up in your arms - all of them - before closing the door behind you and making your way back over to Izuru.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, he's still sitting there, and you place the sandwiches on the coffee table before helping him sit up and gather his hair behind his back so it doesn't get in the way when he's eating. "Thank you," he says softly.<br>
<br>
"It's no problem!" you say, and begin to unwrap the sandwiches. He watches you as you do so, and after a few minutes, the floor is littered with wrappers from various fast food stores. You hand over one of the sandwiches. "Hope that satisfies some of your cravings!"<br>
<br>
He nods and takes a bite.<br>
<br>
It's hypnotizing, really, watching his stomach slowly expand as he practically inhales all the food that you've handed to him. It certainly looks soft and squishy, a wonderful texture indeed, but you know better than to squeeze it when he's still in the process of eating. And so you wait, watching as he becomes softer and more cuddly as he shovel fast food sandwich after fast food sandwich into his mouth.<br>
<br>
He finishes in time, as all things do, and you smile at the rotund and squishy body that lays before you. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and you hand him a napkin, making him mutter a couple words of thanks as he wipes his face before tossing the cloth into a nearby trash can.<br>
Izuru gives pause, looking between you and the trash can and then at his own hands. "Heyâ€¦" he says slowly, "is it alright if we...head to bed, $R$?"<br>
<br>
You nod, and slinging your arm around Izuru, the two of you make your way over to your bed. Despite yourself, you give his shoulder a small squeeze and smile at the texture.<br>
<br>
As the two of you tumble onto your bed, you reach for the bottom of Izuru's shirt before hesitating. "May I?" you ask, and when he nods, you eagerly pull it up and look at the folds of flesh that greet you. You glance up at him as one last reassurance, and he nods once more.<br>
<br>
You sigh contentedly and bury your face into Izuru's belly, gently squeezing it to confirm that it's just as squishy as you imagined it would be and reveling in the softness of it. Even though you're stuck between his folds, you can picture his content and warm expression perfectly as he runs his fingers through your hair clumsily. "You're so soft," you mutter.<br>
<br>
"Pardon?" says Izuru.<br>
<br>
"I <i>said</i>," you repeat, mushing your lips into his stomach and sending vibrations up it, making him laugh softly - the noise is like music to your ears, "you're soft. Like...really soft n' squishy."<br>
<br>
"You say that a lot," Izuru notes, but the humor in his voice makes it clear that he doesn't hate it. "If you're such a fan of how soft I am, then why don't you make me bigger?"<br>
<br>
You pull your face out of his stomach. "Wait," you say, "you're <i>still</i> hungry?"<br>
<br>
He flushes lightly underneath your accusatory gaze. You sigh and push back your hair. "I mean like, yeah, I can make you...bigger," you mutter. "I love how big and cuddly you are. But we're out of food and it's late and I don't have any cash on me, so you're going to have to wait until another day in order to." You pause and make a vague gesture with your hands. "You know. Increase in size."<br>
<br>
Izuru looks at you and laughs, skin wrinkling up around the corners of his eyes. You smile and place your head gently onto his bare stomach once more, absentmindedly noting at how pillow-like his stomach is. You knead it softly with your hands, and Izuru sighs above you.<br>
<br>
"Hey," says Izuru, "if...tomorrow, you could, ah." He pauses and bites his lip. You pull yourself onto your elbows and look at him.<br>
<br>
"Well?" you prompt when he doesn't continue. "What could I do tomorrow?"<br>
<br>
"Would you be willing to," he seems a bit embarrassed by his own words, but continues nonetheless, "willing to...continue with what we did tonight. With feeding me. I most certainly would appreciate it."<br>
<br>
You smile and place a hand over Izuru's belly, kneading it gently. It really is incredibly soft. "Of course," you promise. "I would absolutely love to do that. I might need to order some more food, but it'll be absolutely worth it."<br>
<br>
He leans in and gives you a big smooch on your cheek, rubbing his hands on top of your head with a small smile. "I'm really glad, $R$," he says. "I...really love you, and spending time together like this is. Absolutely one of my favorite things ever."<br>
<br>
You bite back a smile and bury your head back into his stomach. It's so, so soft.<br>
