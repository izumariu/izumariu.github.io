Also, here's my comm info in a raw format(the description file in the ZIP has links to the images in it):


General info

2 panels; top + bottom composition / split horizontally in the middle
2 characters:
PRED: Ginji(Kakuriyo No Yadomeshi), as a macro
PREY: Ninizu(OC, my sona, but chubby)
Soft vore + chub(fat?)



Description

Top panel

Just like cainvsmax.png, but:

Ginji's head is in a higher angle, i.e. the point of his nose is facing a higher point
Nini isn't fighting like Cain is; he's actually enjoying it. He's hugging Ginji's tongue, with a (^âˆ‡^) face(like a waterslide! agameofcatandtiny.png, third panel; that should also be how wide Ginji opens his mouth, exact the same amount of saliva and all that~ *melts*).

Please keep in mind that Nini's tails are big, but he can change their size. In this case, I would recommend them being a bit bigger than Nini himself. 



Bottom panel

Like mountainbreeze.png, but Ginji has a big belly, the size being something like in thepicnic_p3.png, but the belly is smooth and round, no bumps. He is "kneading" it with his right hand(look @ squish.png, that's how soft I want it to be). There should be a speech bubble which shows what he says:

BUUUUURP- See, not only did you satisfy my hunger, you also add to my fat nicely~ 

Of course he needs to have a very happy and satisfied facial expression, hehe! And I want his tummy to be veeeeerry noisy! Add as much noise as possible!

Please exchange Ginji's geta sandals for the shoes that look like shoes.png. And make his soles look as if they are made of squeaky, rubbery latex.

Please try to make his tails look as large and as poofy as possible!
