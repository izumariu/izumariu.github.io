    <h1>Description</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <h2>Top panel</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Just like <a href="img/cainvsmax.png">cainvsmax.png</a>, but:
        <ul>
          <li>Ginji&apos;s head is in a higher angle, i.e. the point of his nose is facing a higher point</li>
          <li>Nini isn&apos;t fighting like Cain is;
            he&apos;s actually enjoying it.
            He&apos;s hugging Ginji&apos;s tongue, with a (^&#8711;^) face(like a waterslide! <a href="img/agameofcatandtiny.png">agameofcatandtiny.png</a>, third panel; that should also be how wide Ginji opens his mouth, exact the same amount of saliva and all that~ *melts*).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Please keep in mind that Nini&apos;s tails are big, but he can change their
          size. In this case, I would recommend them being a bit bigger than Nini himself.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Bottom panel</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Like <a href="img/mountainbreeze.png">mountainbreeze.png</a>, but Ginji has a big belly, the size being something like in <a href="img/thepicnic_p3.png">thepicnic_p3.png</a>, but the belly is smooth and round, no bumps. He is &quot;kneading&quot; it with his right hand(look @ <a href="img/squish.png">squish.png</a>, that's how soft I want it to be). There should be a speech bubble which shows what he says:
        <blockquote class="speechbubble">
          <span class="sfx">BUUUUURP-</span> See, not only did you satisfy my hunger, you also add to my fat nicely~
        </blockquote>
        Of course he needs to have a very happy and satisfied facial expression, hehe! And I want his tummy to be <i>veeeeerry</i> noisy! Add as much noise as possible!<br/>
	<i>Added on 2018-05-25:</i><br/>
	Please exchange Ginji's geta sandals for the shoes that look like <a href="img/shoes.png">shoes.png</a>. And make his soles look as if they are made of squeaky, rubbery latex.<br/>
  <i>Added on 2018-05-27:</i><br/>
  Please try to make his tails look as large and as poofy as possible!
